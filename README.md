# CoinOS

CoinOS is a mobile-friendly Point-of-Sale page that merchants can use to accept Bitcoin payments.

# How it Works

* You create an account and configure some basic parameters for your storefront like a name, logo, and bitcoin receiving address
* You set an exchange rate to be used to convert from your local currency to bitcoin
* CoinOS creates a custom webpage that you can bring up on a mobile device to generate payment requests
* You enter a sale amount in your local currency and CoinOS converts it to bitcoin using your chosen exchange rate
* CoinOS creates a QR code for the payment request with your receiving address and the sale amount encoded
* CoinOS listens for transactions on the Bitcoin network and displays a notification when the requested amount is received at your address
* The details of the transaction and the exchange rate used at the time of sale are recorded and made available in a convenient report

# Technical Details

The site is programmed in HTML and Coffeescript using NodeJS and jQuery. Account details and transaction data are stored in a Redis database.  Users are responsible for providing their own receiving addresses managed with whatever wallet they prefer, so CoinOS never stores any bitcoins.

We use the websocket payment notification API from http://blockchain.info/api/api_websocket to listen for and display payment notifications in real time. The bitcoin exchange rates are fetched from http://bitcoinaverage.com/

# Installation

Install nodeJS (http://nodejs.org/) and redis (http://redis.io/) then:

	On Ubuntu
	nodeJS:
		curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup | sudo bash -
		sudo apt-get install -y nodejs
	
	redis:
			 wget http://download.redis.io/releases/redis-2.8.17.tar.gz
			 tar xzf redis-2.8.17.tar.gz
			 cd redis-2.8.17
			 make
	run redis:
			src/redis-server


    git clone https://github.com/thebitcoincoop/coinos
    cd coinos
    npm install  
		nodejs install.js
		# Change the config.js.sample to config.js and add the admin credentials
		nodejs app.js

Now the app should be running at http://localhost:3000/
